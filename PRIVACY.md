# Privacy Policy for Multi AI Prompter

**Effective Date:** March 12, 2025

## Introduction

Multi AI Prompter ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection and usage.

## Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from our users.**

The extension operates entirely within your browser and only facilitates interactions between you and the AI services you choose to use (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok).

## Local Storage

Multi AI Prompter may store the following information locally on your device:
- Your extension preferences and settings
- Recent prompts you've entered (stored only in your browser's local storage)

This information never leaves your device and is used solely to improve your experience with the extension.

## Third-Party Services

When you use our extension to interact with third-party AI services (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok), your interactions with those services are governed by their respective privacy policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these services.

## Permissions

Our extension requests certain browser permissions (such as activeTab, contextMenus, and storage) to function properly. These permissions are used only to provide the core functionality of comparing AI responses and do not enable data collection.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.
